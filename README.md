# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Snake Game** using Python's Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to eat the red food by controlling the snake and avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Game Overview

- **Snake**: You control a black snake that starts with one segment. The snake grows longer as it eats the red food.
- **Food**: Randomly placed on the screen for the snake to eat. Each time the snake eats the food, its length increases, and the score goes up by 10 points.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Score Tracking**: Your current score is displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Randomized Food Placement**: The food is randomly placed on the screen every time itâ€™s eaten.
- **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions with the wall or the snake's own body.
